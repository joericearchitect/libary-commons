# libary-commons
Commons Utils is a collection of general-purpose utility classes.  

Includes such classes as JsonUtil, etc.

Note:  One of the goals is to NOT try to re-invent the wheel or duplicate efforts.  The preference is to use stable, reliable open-source utility classes over home-grown code.

So, the utilities in these classes either A) represent utility logic that is not covered by existing open-source projects, or higher-level abstractions and convience methods on top of existing open-source projects.
